# Api-FrontendTests

Welcome Dear Tappointment employee!

You can review all my API and Frontend tests under the Actions tab of this Repository.
By clicking on the previous workflow runs you can download the Run Reports.
After unzipping them and opening htmlreport.html you can access all individual tests, that I created using Postman.

Here is my Postman workspace, if you would like to see the codes.

Enjoy!
